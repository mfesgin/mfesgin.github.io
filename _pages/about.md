I am interested in mathematical aspects of cybersecurity, particularly around cryptography. My current research focuses are quantum-safe cryptography (particularly, from lattices and hash functions), privacy-preserving protocols, zero-knowledge proofs and blockchain protocols as well as their real-life applications to establish various security features such as confidentiality, integrity, privacy, anonymity and accountability in practice. I have also worked on symmetric-key cryptography and classical public-key cryptography.

I have PhD scholarships available. If you're interested in pursuing a PhD under my supervision, please contact me via email with the subject line "Prospective PhD student - <Your Name>". A strong mathematical background is needed, but a strong cryptography background is not necessarily a must (but it's of course a plus).

This webpage is currently under development. If you spot any issues, please contact me via email (provided at the end of the page).
