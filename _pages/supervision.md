### Prospective Students

I have **multiple PhD scholarships available**. If you're interested in pursuing a PhD under my supervision, please refer to the information below and contact me via email with the subject line "Prospective PhD student - \<Your Name\>". 


##### Requirements

A strong mathematical background is **required**, but a strong cryptography background is not necessarily a must (but it's of course a plus). Some knowledge/experience in coding (for example, Python, C/C++, SageMath) is also a plus. Candidates **must** have completed a significant research component either as part of their undergraduate (honours) degree or masters degree.



##### Why choose to pursue a PhD at Monash University or in Australia more generally?

Australian universities generally offer highly competetive stipend scholarships, at least at the rate detailed [here](https://www.education.gov.au/research-block-grants/research-training-program) (which is currently around AU$30,000 per annum). A standard Monash Faculty of IT scholarship for 2023 is AU$33,000 (tax free). This scholarship does *not require* a PhD student to carry out any teaching duties. However, many students voluntarily take up teaching assistant (TA) duties (known mostly as tutoring in Australia). Depending on the activity type and number of activities undertaken, the teaching income can amount to a significant value, for example, between $5K to $15K. You can refer to [here](https://www.monash.edu/enterprise-agreements/staff-salary-rates/teaching-associate-and-casual-academic-research-assistant) for the official Monash rates for teaching associate duties. 

In general, there are three parts to the scholarship offered by Monash: (i) tuition fee waiver, (ii) stipend scholarship (as described above), and (iii) health insurance cover. Successful applicants will receive all three supports together. 

Monash University is one of the top universities in Australia and is ranked #44 in the Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings 2023. Monash is also home to one of the strongest cryptography and cybersecurity research groups in Australia (and more broadly in the Asia-Pacific region). 

[The cybersecurity group](https://www.monash.edu/it/ssc/cybersecurity) at Monash has a particular focus on cryptography and its applications (e.g., to blockchain). We aim to have a collaborative, friendly environment for anyone involved in the group. As a researcher in the group, PhD candidates get an excellent opportunity to collaborate with leading researchers in cybersecurity both internally at Monash and externally thanks to the group's existing connections and joint grants.


##### Why choose to live and study in Melbourne?

Melbourne constantly ranks as one of the most liveable cities in the world. It is also ranked as one of the safest cities (according to [Safe Cities Index 2021](https://safecities.economist.com/safe-cities-2021-whitepaper/)). Melbourne has a diverse and welcoming environment for people from all around the world with more than 100 cultures represented. Melbourne is also very proud of its coffee culture :) You can find more reasons for 'Why Melbourne' at [this website](https://liveinmelbourne.vic.gov.au/discover/melbourne-victoria/why-melbourne).
