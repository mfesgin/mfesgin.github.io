# Prospective Students

I have **PhD scholarships available**. If you're interested in pursuing a PhD under my supervision, please contact me via email with the subject line "Prospective PhD student - \<Your Name\>". A strong mathematical background is **required**, but a strong cryptography background is not necessarily a must (but it's of course a plus). Make sure to include all of your transcripts (with grading schema) and your CV that details your GPA out of the total for each of your study (starting from your undergraduate degree).


# Current/Past PhD Students

1. Nikai Jagganath \[2023--present\]
	- works on quantum security analysis of post-quantum cryptography schemes 
1. Xinyu Zhang \[2021--present\]
	- works on post-quantum cryptography solutions based on symmetic-key primitives
