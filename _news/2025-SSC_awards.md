I have been awarded both an **Education Excellence** and a **Research Excellence Award** at Department of Software Systems and Cybersecurity - Monash Faculty of IT! The Education Excellence Award is one of the most competitive awards on the education side and is open to academics at all levels. The research award was given in the category of Research Excellence Team Award to the Post-Quantum Cryptography Research Team that includes Ron Steinfeld, Amin Sakzad and myself.
